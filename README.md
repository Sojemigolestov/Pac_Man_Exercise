# PacMen Exercise! 

# Project description

PacMan exercise that features a factory to randomly spawn more PacMen and set random velocities for each one. It also comes with a built-in collision detection system so that the PacMen never go out of bounds and keep moving within the page boundaries.

# How to run

To run this project simply clone the repository and either double-click the index file or drag it onto your browser. Remember to keep all the files within the same directory!

# Roadmap of future improvements

In future iterations of this project I will implement colour selection to make the PacMen more distinguishable from each other. Also I'll implement sound to the collision detection system to have audio feedback and more interactivity.
